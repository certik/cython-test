Pure Python
-----------

$ python run.py

This loads the fact.py, which is in pure Python.

Cython in pure Python mode
--------------------------

$ cython fact.py

See the generated fact.c, which contains a pure C for loop (e.g. it's very
fast). Cython just uses a Python code and fact.pxd which contains additional
information to help Cython produce a very fast C code.
